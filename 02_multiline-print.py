# Print multiline string
print('''Computers are fast: computers are amazingly fast. 
If you know how to properly utilize the power of 
Computer programming, you can do wonders with it.
For a typical computer of today’s time, an addition
of 2 numbers which could be as big as a billion each
takes hardly a nanosecond. Read again - nanosecond!
That means that in 1 second, a computer can perform
about a billion additions. Can any human ever do that?
Forget a billion additions a second, typical human can’t
even do 10 additions per second. So, computers offer great speed.''')
